## Contents
* WeatherPy/
  * WeatherPy.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook that created a randomized list of cities. Utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to search for each city and stores various weather statistics about each city. Some relationships between the statistics are graphed and linear regression models are made to examine the strength of the relationships.
  * output_data/
    * Cities.csv - City data created from OpenWeatherMap API
    * 12 PNGs of graphs analyzing various relations of latitude and weather statistics
* VacationPy/
  * VacationPy.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook that reads the city data created from WeatherPy and plots them using gmaps. It searches through certain criteria to find the most desirable areas to take a vacation based on the data and uses the Google Places API to find hotels near the filtered cities. The hotels are then plotted using gmaps.
